# iq.com-Downloader-V2
Downloads videos from iq.com

This is a new an improved version of my old script https://github.com/TAJLNsScripts/iq.com-downloader
Selenium is no longer used which means the script will be faster and hopefully more reliable.


Prerequisites:
- iq.com account (for VIP and 1080p content)

Usage:
1. (OPTIONAL) Login to iq.com and copy cookies to "cookies.py" (I like to find a request that uses cookies in the network tab of DevTools and copy the curl(bash) to curlconverter.com which converts it to python code)
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python iq.py
